# Time: look for loops
## O(n): go through elements 1 time
### example: one loop = O(n) then another loop = O(n) = 2n but drop the 2 = n
## O(n^2): loop inside another loop
## O(1): regardless if input grows, complete in same amount of time
## log(n): binary search stuff ===optimization

# Space
## Check if array/hash is growing that I created
